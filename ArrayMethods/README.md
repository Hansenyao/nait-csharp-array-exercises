# A array programming exercise - Array and Method

## Step 1
- Create a program that will allow the user to enter up to 25 numbers into an array. 
- Calculate and display the mean average of the numbers.

## Step 2
- Update your solution to the previous problem (make a copy and save as a new project) to use two methods with the following signatures in your solution:

    - The method will load user input numbers into the array and return the count of numbers entered.
 
    ``` 
    Function GetUserNumbers(Integer[ ] Numbers) As Int
    ```
    - The method will return the mean average of the numbers in the array.
    ```
    Function MeanAverageOfNumbers(Integer[ ] Numbers, Integer Count) As Integer
    ```
## Step 3
- Modify the previous program (make a copy and save as a new project) so that the program also displays the largest value, the smallest value, and the mode (if you donâ€™t know what the mode is, look it up) of the numbers. 
- Use a modular approach in your solution. Your program should have at a minimum the following methods:
    - The method will return the index of the largest number in the array.
    ```
    Function LargestNumber(Integer[ ] Nums, Integer Count) As Integer
    ```
    - The method will return the index of the smallest number in the array.
    ```
    Function SmallestNumber(Integer[ ] Nums, Integer Count) As Integer
    ```
    - The method will return the mode of the numbers (if there is more than one, only one needs to be shown).
    ```
    Function Mode(Integer[ ] Nums, Integer Count) As Integer
    ```
